# CropAdvisor - A Recommenation System 

Crop Advisor is an intelligent agricultural management system designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in making informed decisions regarding crop selection, fertilization, pest identification, and more. The system leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to provide valuable recommendations and insights for optimizing crop yields and farming practices.




## Key Features

1. Crop Recommendation: 
Our system predicts the most suitable crop for a given set of environmental and soil conditions. Farmers can input data such as nutrient levels, pH, rainfall, and temperature to receive personalized crop suggestions.

2. Fertilizer Recommendation: 
Crop Advisor recommends appropriate fertilizers based on nutrient deficiencies in the soil. It considers the desired nutrient levels for specific crops and suggests the necessary amendments.

3. Pest Identification: 
Using a trained deep learning model, the system identifies common agricultural pests from uploaded images. It helps farmers quickly recognize and address potential threats to their crops.

4. Farmer Registration: 
Farmers can register their information, including personal details and farm specifics, enabling them to access personalized recommendations and maintain a digital farming profile.
